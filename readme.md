# Solar self-consumption model

- using high resolution 10s solar generation data from an emoncms feed
- creates household consumption model to experiment with load timing and types
- simulates PV Diversion with hot water cylinder
- simple EV charging profile option
- saves modelled consumption feed and cylinder temperature to output emoncms feeds
